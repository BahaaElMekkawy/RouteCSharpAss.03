Assignment 3 
1- Write a program that takes a number from the user then print yes if that number can be divided by 3 and 4 otherwise print no.
    Example (1)
    Input: 12 
    Output: Yes
    Example (2)
    Input: 9 
    Output: No



2- Write a program that allows the user to insert an integer then print negative if it is negative number otherwise print positive.
    Example (1)
    Input: -5
    Output: negative
    Example (2)
    Input: 10
    Output: positive



3- Write a program that takes 3 integers from the user then prints the max element and the min element.
    Example (1)
    Input:7,8,5
    Output:
    max element = 8
    min element = 5
    Example (2)
    Input: 3 6 9
    Outputs:
    Max element = 9
    Min element = 3

4- Write a program that allows the user to insert an integer number then check If a number is even or odd.

5- Write a program that takes character from the user then if it is a vowel chars (a,e,I,o,u) then print (vowel) otherwise print (consonant).
    Example (1)
    Input: O
    Output: vowel
    Example (2)
    Input: b
    Output: Consonant

6- Write a program that allows the user to insert an integer then 
print a multiplication table up to 12.
    Example
    Input: 5
    Outputs: 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60

7- Write a program that allows to user to insert number then print all even numbers between 1 to this number
    Example:
    Input: 15
 Output: 2 4 6 8 10 12 14



8- Write a program that takes two integers then prints the power.
    Example:
    Input: 4 3
    Output: 64
    Hint: how to calculate 4^3 = 4 * 4 * 4 =64



9- Write a program to input the month number and print the number of days in that month.
    Example
    Input: Month Number: 1
    Output: Days in Month: 31





10- Within a company, the efficiency of workers is evaluated based on the duration required to complete a specific task. A worker's efficiency level is determined as follows: 
- If the worker completes the job within 2 to 3 hours, they are considered highly efficient. 
- If the worker takes 3 to 4 hours, they are instructed to increase their speed. 
- If the worker takes 4 to 5 hours, they are provided with training to enhance their speed. 
- If the worker takes more than 5 hours, they are required to leave the company. 
To calculate the efficiency of a worker, the time taken for the task is obtained via user input from the keyboard.
